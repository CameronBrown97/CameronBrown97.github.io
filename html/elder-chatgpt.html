        <p class="imgDesc">
            The purpose of the website to allow people to take a cognitive impairment test for free. They will have<br>
            their voice recordings processed by an AI model to determine if they need to go see a doctor.

            My contribution to the back end was focused on the admin dashboard. The following image shows what the<br>
            dashboard looks like when first directed to it. On the left side of the screen, there is a list of all<br>
            the users that took the exams (test data).
        </p>
        <div id="img1Container">

        <p class="imgDesc">
            Now there can be many people who take the exam. That is why I had created a way of filtering out users<br>
            Based on their first name. This will more than likely change to filter based on the users' email<br>
            addresses.

            When you select the one you want it will have two other filters for you to choose. The first one is which<br>
            of the two tests you would like to see. Once that filter is selected, you'll be able to select which day<br>
            they took the test. Once the date is selected, it will then display the answers that the user entered.<br>
        </p>

             alt="elder-chatgpt dashboard with filter of test" id="img3">
        <p>
            The idea of this is to be able to edit the users' answers if they had accidentally entered the 'wrong'<br>
            answer.
